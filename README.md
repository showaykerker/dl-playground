# dl-playground
Just a playground for any random libraries I wanna play around with (mostly gonna be deep learning).

Basic tasks (familiarizing with Keras/TF):
- MNIST
- Image recognition
- Image captioning

Here are a list of small "toy projects" I'll be doing in this playground:
- Generate conversation given FB chat
- Generate music
- Game playing (simple)
- DeepBlue replica w/ DNN

OpenAI Environments
- Cartpole
- Mountain Car
- Walking
- Universe 

Advanced:
- MarI/O replica
- Image question answering
- GANs
- GPU/C++
