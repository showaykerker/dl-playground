# dl-playground
Just a playground for any random libraries I wanna play around with (mostly gonna be deep learning).

Basic tasks (familiarizing with Keras/TF):
- Image recognition
- Image captioning

Here are a list of small "toy projects" I'll be doing in this playground:
- Convert B/W images to color
- Generate conversation given FB chat
- Generate music
- Automatic hand writing generator
- Game playing (simple)
- DeepBlue replica w/ DNN
- Punctuation predictor

FB chat
Flappy bird

OpenAI Environments
- Cartpole
- Mountain Car
- Walking
- Universe 

Advanced:
- MarI/O replica
- Image captioning
- Image question answering
- GANs
- GPU/C++
