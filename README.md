# dl-playground
Just a playground for any random libraries I wanna play around with (mostly gonna be deep learning).

Here are a list of small "toy projects" I'll be doing in this playground:
- Convert B/W images to color
- Generate music
- Generate conversation given FB chat
- Automatic hand writing generator
- Machine translation
- Game playing (simple)
- Mar i/o replica
- Train a word2vec classifier
